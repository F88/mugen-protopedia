# 🎮 Player Guide

Welcome! This guide helps you install and play Mugen ProtoPedia with the best experience across desktop and mobile.

## ❓ What is Mugen ProtoPedia?

An endless, serendipity-first viewer for prototypes on [ProtoPedia](https://protopedia.net/). Browse randomly, discover unexpectedly, and get inspired.

## 🚀 Recommended Environments to Play

📝 This app can open any prototype in your default web browser from within the app. Because the hand-off process (Browser vs. Installed App) may differ by platform, we encourage you to **choose the experience that best suits your preferences**.

### 🖥️ Desktop Usage

The application functions well in both installed and browser modes. The browser version may be preferred by users who prioritize seamless integration with their existing tabs.

- **Windows/macOS/Linux**
    - **Recommended Browser:** Latest stable Chrome or Edge.
    - **Installation Method (for PWA):** Look for the **"Install" icon** (usually in the address bar) or access the install option via the **Browser Menu**.
    - **Note:** Both the browser and installed PWA versions are fully supported.
- **macOS (Safari)**
    - **Support:** Fully supported.
    - **Installation Method (for PWA):** The PWA installation method is available via the **Address Bar "Install" button** or the **Browser Menu**, depending on your version.

### 📱 Mobile Usage (Installed App Recommended for Performance)

While the browser is supported, we recommend **installing the PWA** for native-like performance and better utilization of the smaller screen space.

- **Android**
    - **Recommended Browser:** Latest stable Chrome.
    - **Installation Method (for PWA):** An **automatic install prompt (A2HS)** may appear at the bottom of the screen when all requirements are met.
    - **Note:** The installed app (PWA) often delivers better overall performance and screen usage on mobile devices.
- **iOS/iPadOS**
    - **Recommended Browser:** Safari.
    - **Installation Method (for PWA):** **Manual Installation is Required.** Use the **Share button** then select **Add to Home Screen**.
    - **Note:** Safari is the only browser supported for PWA installation on these devices, as automatic prompts are not allowed.
